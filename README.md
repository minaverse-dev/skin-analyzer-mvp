> An IoT-enabled beauty device with modular tips for skin diagnostics and real-time data sync.

## 🖼️ Hardware Mockup

![Skin Analyzer Mockup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minaverse-dev/skin-analyzer-mvp/main/assets/mockups/skin-analyzer-mockup-v1.png)

## 🚀 [Live Demo](https://minaverse-dev.github.io/skin-analyzer-mvp/)

💻 A live frontend prototype simulating the web-based skin analysis process.  
📸 We recommend taking a real-time photo for accurate color analysis.  
🔒 No photo data is collected. It's just HTML.

### Features
- Camera-based photo input
- File upload, Desktop only (drag & drop supported)
- Interactive AI analysis demo
- Responsive UI for desktop
- CSS animations and smooth transitions

> Vanilla JavaScript beauty tech prototype with zero dependencies.  
> Features file upload, drag-and-drop API, CSS animations, and responsive design.  
> Clean code architecture with modern ES6+ and mobile-first approach.

### Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome, Firefox, Safari (Desktop)
